## ZMK

This folder contains the port of my keymap to ZMK.
The full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/rafaelromao/keyboards). 

### Missing features:
- Orbital Mouse
- Windows Support

### Known Issues:
- Swapping between Applications and Tabs must start in the forward direction.
- Swapping between the Navigation History must start in the backward direction.
- Smart Case does not support Slash Case, since ZMK can't distinguish Stick Shift from a held Shift.

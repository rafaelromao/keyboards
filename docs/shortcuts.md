## Shortcuts and Macros

- A Shortcuts layer can be activated holding any of the home row pinky keys.
- The Shortcuts layer not only gives access to some common programming macros and shortcuts but also some complex features, like Select Word, Window Swapper and the ability to record and play Dynamic Macros, as well as the inverted space and backspace keys.

### Leader Key
- The Leader Key is available in the Shortcuts layer and can give easy access to some useful shortcuts and macros, like typing an internet domain or recurring terminal commands.
- Source code: [leader.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/leader.c)

### Swapper
- Swapper is a set of macros that allows easy swap between applications, tabs, navigation history and zoom levels.
- These macros will work according to the OS selected in the System layer.
- There are two pairs of dedicated keys.
- The implementation was based on [Callums's](https://github.com/callum-oakley/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/callum) implementation, but extended to support additional features.
- Source Code: [swapper.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/swapper.c)
#### Applications and Tabs
- The first pair swaps back and forth between applications.
- If shift is active in the first tap, they navigate between the current application tabs instead.
    - And tapping both keys will close the current browser tab.
#### History and Zoom
- The second pair will decrease or increase zoom.
- If shift is active in the first tap, they will navigate in the browser history instead.
- Tapping both keys will refresh the current browser tab.
- If shift is active when tapping both keys, they will clear cache and refresh the current browser tab.

### Select Word and Select Line
- These two macros selects the current word or line in the first press and extend the selection to the next ones in consecutive presses.
- These macros are also OS aware and works the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
- The implementation was based on [Pascal's](https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap) implementation, but it does not work the same way.
- Source Code: [select_word.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/select_word.c)

### Comment Lines
- This macro comments/uncomments the current line or selected text block.
- Source Code: [macros.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/macros.c)

### Join Lines
- This macro joins the current line with the line bellow it.
- Source Code: [macros.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/macros.c)

### Dynamic Macros
- There is an independent dynamic macro recording key in the Macros layer.
- Double tapping it will start or stop recording a dynamic macro.
- Tapping it will play the dynamic macro.
- If shift is active, it will consider the macro slot 2, otherwise it will consider the macro slot 1.
- If there is a macro being recorded, use the thumb modifier keys to stop recording and clear the current macro.
- Source Code: [dynamic_macro.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/dynamic_macro.c)

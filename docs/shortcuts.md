## Shortcuts

- A Shortcuts layer can be activated holding any of the home row pinky keys.
- This layer gives access to some complex features, like Select Word and shortcuts to some commonly used applications and app shortcuts.
- Up and Down arrows, Enter and Esc are also available in the right side of this layer to make it easier to navigate in context menus.

### Select Word and Select Line
- These two macros selects the current word or line in the first press and extend the selection to the next ones in consecutive presses.
- These macros are also OS aware and works the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
- The implementation was based on [Pascal's](https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap) implementation, but it does not work the same way.

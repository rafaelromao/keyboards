## Symbols and Numbers
Symbols and Numbers are primarily available in the two classic Lower and Raise layers, activated holding the space and backspace thumb keys, respectively.
- Symbols are available in the left side of the Lower layer and in the right side of the Raise layer, making them easier to reach with a single hand.
- There are combos to allow cross activation and one-shot activation of both symbol layers.
- Numbers are available in the right side of the Lower layer.
- Function keys are available in the left side of the Raise layer.

### Symbols in the Lower layer (left side)
- String delimiters, parenthesis, curly and square brackets, among others, are found in the left side of the Lower layer.

### Numbers in the Lower layer (right side)
- In the right side of the Lower layer, there is a set of number keys, arranged as a numpad, but using number row keycodes.
  - If shift is active, these number keys will output numpad keys instead.
- The Raise layer can be activated on top of the Lower layer, holding the right thumb key, which makes it easier to access math operators when working with numbers.

### Functions in the Raise layer (left side)
- On the left side of the Raise layer, the F keys are available in the mirrored positions as their respective numbers, making it easier to assimilate.

### Symbols in the Raise layer (right side)
- Symbols that are commonly used in VIM are placed in the right side of the Raise layer, making them easily accessible using only the right hand.
- Some common programmer n-grams, like ->, =>, \<!--, -->, <>, />, !=, :=, +=, -=, can all be typed rolling through keys in the right hand.

### NumWord
- NumWord is a variation of CapsWord, but for numbers instead. A combo with ring and middle fingers in the left side bottom row will activate the Lower layer and it will stay active while numbers or symbols are typed, returning to the base layer otherwise.

### Coding Dancing
- Coding Dancing is a set of macros available through tap dances (Double Tap) in the Lower layer.
- It allows fast typing for some of the most frequent Java keywords and code blocks.

## Symbols and Numbers
Symbols and Numbers are primarily available in the two classic Lower and Raise layers, activated holding the space and backspace thumb keys, respectively.

### Num Word
- Num Word is a variation of Caps Word, but for numbers instead. A combo with ring and middle fingers in the left side bottom row will activate the Lower layer and it will stay active while numbers or symbols are typed, returning to the base layer otherwise.

### Pontuation Hold
- Holding a pontuation key (dot, comma or semicolon) will add it to the end of the current line.
